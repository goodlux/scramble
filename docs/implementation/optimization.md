# Semantic Compression Optimization

## Current Focus Areas

### Token Usage Optimization
- [ ] Implement dynamic chunk sizing based on token budget
- [ ] Add token usage tracking and metrics
- [ ] Optimize context selection algorithm

### Compression Quality
- [ ] Add compression quality metrics
- [ ] Implement information density scoring
- [ ] Add semantic similarity validation

### Monitoring & Debug Tools
- [ ] Add compression metrics dashboard
- [ ] Enhance debug commands for compression analysis
- [ ] Add token usage reporting

## Implementation Notes

### Token Budget Management
Current approach:
- Base chunk size: 512 tokens
- Dynamic adjustment based on text length
- Target compression ratio: 3:1

Planned improvements:
- Implement sliding window compression
- Add token budget constraints
- Track token usage across conversation chain

### Metrics Implementation
Key metrics to track:
- Compression ratio
- Semantic similarity preservation
- Token usage efficiency
- Information density
