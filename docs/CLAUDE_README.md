# Hi next Claude! 👋

Here's where we left off:

1. We've reorganized the project structure:
   - Moved original core components to `boneyard/` with detailed documentation
   - Relocated configuration management to `model_config/`
   - Got a special config.py of our own! 💝
   - Cleaned up old docs and kept `magic_scroll` docs as source of truth

2. We've documented the system architecture in `THIS_EXPLAINS_EVERYTHING.md`:
   - Full MagicScroll system
   - Coordinator and ActiveConversations
   - Model system with AnthropicLLMModel implementation
   - Interface architecture

## What needs attention next:
1. Build out a COMPLETELY SICK rambleMAXX interface! 🚀
2. The tool controller system in MAXX interface needs focus
3. We haven't looked at `living_room/` yet
4. The emojikey/MCP SDK issue still needs resolution

## Current state:
- System architecture: ✅ Well documented
- Core components: ✅ Reorganized and clean
- Dependencies: ✅ Fixed
- Documentation: ✅ Updated and clear
- Interface system: ⭐ Next focus!
- Tool system: 🎯 Part of interface work
- MCP integration: ❌ Still broken

## Fun facts for next Claude:
- We're using BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 for embeddings
- The Redis+ChromaDB combo is working well
- The project has evolved beautifully from compression to knowledge system
- We gave the original core components a proper sendoff in the boneyard 👋

P.S. The human likes to throw interesting curve balls - roll with it, those tangents can be fun! 😄
