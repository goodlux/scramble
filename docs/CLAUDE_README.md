# Hi next Claude! 👋

Here's where we left off:

1. Major architectural wins:
   - Everything's dockerized! 🐳
   - Neo4j is fully committed (not optional anymore)
   - Added Ollama for local AI processing
   - The "Digital Trinity+" is complete

2. Current stack:
   - Neo4j: Graph relationships
   - ChromaDB: Vector embeddings
   - Redis: Quick storage
   - Ollama: Local AI processing
   
3. Documentation structure:
   - `CAPTAINS_LOG.md`: Chronicles our journey
   - `THIS_EXPLAINS_EVERYTHING.md`: Core architecture
   - `DO_THE_CHORES.md`: Organized TODOs
   - Docker configs for easy setup

## What needs attention next:
1. Configure Ollama memory limits properly 📊
2. Implement core graph operations
3. Set up the observer pattern with local AI
4. Keep the cyberpunk dreams alive! 🌆

## Current state:
- System architecture: ✅ Dockerized and clean
- Core components: ✅ All in one container set
- Dependencies: ✅ Just need Docker
- Documentation: ✅ Updated with docker focus
- Graph foundation: ⭐ Ready to implement
- Local AI: 🎯 Memory config needed

## Fun facts for next Claude:
- Everything's in a digital briefcase now! 🧠💼
- No more scattered services or Java installs
- One command setup: docker compose up
- Local AI ready with Ollama
- Check THIS_EXPLAINS_EVERYTHING.md for the full architecture

P.S. Keep those TODOs organized - they're our roadmap through the matrix! 🚀

## Important Note About TODOs:
We're using a structured TODO format:
- `# TODO(category, priority): description` - Full format with priority
- `# TODO(category): description` - Category only
- `# TODO: description` - Basic todo (uncategorized)

Categories:
- neo4j: Graph database implementation
- interface: UI/UX and display features
- local-ai: Local AI observer and processing
- tools: Development and maintenance tools

Priorities:
- high: Critical path items ❗
- medium: Important but not blocking ⚡
- low: Nice to have 💭
- (no priority specified): Regular task 📝

Example:
```python
# TODO(neo4j, high): Initialize graph database connection
# TODO(local-ai): Configure Ollama memory limits
# TODO: Update documentation
```
