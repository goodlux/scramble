## Recent Progress: Core Architecture Solidified

We've established and cleaned up the core conversation architecture:

### Key Components:
1. **Coordinator as Central Hub**
   - All interactions flow through Coordinator
   - Clean separation of responsibilities
   - Single source of truth for system state
   - Handles MagicScroll interactions

2. **Model Management**
   - Models handle only their specific communication tasks
   - No direct access to MagicScroll or other components
   - Clean model addition/removal system
   - Support for multiple active models

3. **Conversation Flow**
   - Model addressing with @ syntax
   - Inter-model communication
   - Proper speaker indicators
   - Enhanced prompt handling

4. **Interface Improvements**
   - Color-coded speaker indicators
   - Improved visual feedback
   - Clear conversation structure
   - Custom model personalities

### Current Status:
- Using Granite (granite3.1-dense:2b) as primary model
- Working model addition ("@granite add sonnet")
- Proper conversation routing
- Basic personality system via system prompts

### Next Focus Areas:
1. **Conversation Dynamics**
   - Enhance inter-model interactions
   - Improve context awareness
   - Better handling of model roles
   - More natural conversation flow

2. **Model Personalities**
   - Refine system prompts
   - Better role definition
   - Consistent character traits
   - Improved interaction patterns

3. **System Architecture**
   - Monitor Coordinator complexity
   - Enhance error handling
   - Improve conversation saving
   - Add more robust testing

### Development Philosophy:
- Keep Coordinator as the central hub
- Maintain clean component separation
- Focus on conversation quality
- Build for extensibility

Keep building the cyberpunk dream! ðŸŒ†
