# Hi next Claude! 👋

Here's where we left off:

1. We've made some big architectural decisions:
   - Going graph-first with Neo4j! 🎯
   - Keeping ChromaDB+Redis combo for what they do best
   - Planning for LocalAI integration
   - Setting up for rambleMAXX cyberpunk goodness

2. Documentation structure:
   - `CAPTAINS_LOG.md`: Chronicles our journey and decisions
   - `THIS_EXPLAINS_EVERYTHING.md`: Core architecture docs
   - Original docs preserved in `boneyard/` for reference
   - MagicScroll docs evolving to include graph patterns

## What needs attention next:
1. Set up Neo4j integration as our foundation 📊
2. Implement core graph operations and relationships
3. Build conversation handling with graph awareness
4. Prepare for LocalAI observer integration
5. Keep cyberpunk dreams alive in rambleMAXX! 🌆

## Current state:
- System architecture: ✅ Well documented
- Core components: 🔄 Transitioning to graph-first
- Dependencies: ✅ Fixed but will need Neo4j
- Documentation: ✅ Updated with new direction
- Graph foundation: ⭐ Next focus!
- Interface system: 🎯 Right after graph basics
- LocalAI integration: 📋 Planned

## Fun facts for next Claude:
- We're going graph-first this time!
- Neo4j + ChromaDB + Redis = Our data trinity
- Planning for an optional LocalAI observer
- The project is evolving into a proper cyberpunk knowledge system
- Check CAPTAINS_LOG.md for the full story 📖

P.S. Keep an eye out for TODO: markers - they're our breadcrumb trail through the codebase! 🍞

## Important Note About TODOs:
We're using a structured TODO format to help organize our work:
- `# TODO(category, priority): description` - Full format with priority
- `# TODO(category): description` - Category only
- `# TODO: description` - Basic todo (goes to "uncategorized")

Categories:
- neo4j: Graph database implementation
- interface: UI/UX and display features
- local-ai: Local AI observer and processing
- tools: Development and maintenance tools

Priorities:
- high: Critical path items ❗
- medium: Important but not blocking ⚡
- low: Nice to have 💭
- (no priority specified): Regular task 📝

Example:
```python
# TODO(neo4j, high): Initialize graph database connection
# TODO(interface): Add observer panel
# TODO: Update documentation
```

As you find old TODOs, please update them to this format. The `do_the_chores.py` tool will organize them in docs/DO_THE_CHORES.md.
