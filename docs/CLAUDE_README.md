# Claude's Development Notes

## Current Status
The project is undergoing a significant refactor of the ChromaDB implementation. We discovered that our current implementation has become overly complex and may not properly integrate with LlamaIndex's expectations.

## Known Issues
1. ChromaDB client implementation needs complete revision
   - Current implementation is over-engineered
   - May conflict with LlamaIndex requirements
   - Too many abstraction layers
   - Complex error handling may be unnecessary

2. Need to verify:
   - Correct ChromaDB client usage
   - LlamaIndex integration requirements
   - Proper async implementation

## Working Components to Preserve
- Neo4j integration
- Entity extraction
- Message enrichment
- Redis implementation
- Basic search functionality

## Next Steps
1. Document current implementation (completed)
2. Reset ChromaDB implementation
3. Rebuild with focus on:
   - Correct ChromaDB client usage
   - LlamaIndex compatibility
   - Minimal necessary abstraction
   - Proper async patterns
   - Efficient error handling

## Development Guidelines
1. Maintain clean separation of concerns
2. Focus on minimal, necessary abstractions
3. Ensure compatibility with LlamaIndex
4. Prioritize reliability over feature completeness
5. Document assumptions and dependencies clearly

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider breaking complex components into smaller, focused modules
- Maintain thorough documentation of dependencies and version requirements
- Keep track of successful patterns for reuse
- Test integration points thoroughly
- Document API changes and migration paths
