# Identity Context System Design
Date: November 5, 2024

## Overview
The identity context system provides persistent identity and relationship information across conversations, enabling more personalized and context-aware interactions.

### Core Components

1. Identity Context Layer
- Stores user attributes and preferences
- Manages relationship dynamics
- Handles identimoji representation
- Provides personality persistence

2. Identity Data Structure
```python
class IdentityContext:
    attributes: Dict[str, Any]  # Core user attributes
    identimoji: str            # 48-char identity representation
    preferences: Dict[str, Any] # User preferences
    relationship: Dict[str, Any] # Interaction dynamics
```

3. Integration Points
- Loaded at conversation start
- Updated at conversation end
- Referenced during context retrieval
- Used for conversation calibration

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Identity
- Core attribute storage
- Basic identimoji support
- Simple preference tracking

### Phase 2: Enhanced Relationship
- Relationship dynamics tracking
- Interaction style adaptation
- Identity evolution support

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Multi-user support
- Identity verification
- Privacy controls
- Identity portability

## Privacy and Security
- Local storage only
- Encrypted attributes
- User control over sharing
- Clear data boundaries
