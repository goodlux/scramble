# Interface Architecture Checkpoint
Date: December 14, 2024

## Core Achievements

### 1. Interface Architecture
- Clean separation of interface concerns
- Hierarchy of interfaces:
  - `InterfaceBase`: Core functionality
  - `RambleInterface`: CLI-specific features
  - `MAXXInterface`: TUI-specific features
- Abstract methods enforcing consistent implementation
- Shared capabilities system

### 2. Controller Pattern
- Separated specific concerns into controllers:
  - `MessageController`: Chat handling
  - `ContextController`: Context and command management
  - `ToolController`: Tool registration and execution
- Clean interaction between controllers and interfaces

### 3. Model Coordination
- Integrated LLMHarness for model management
- Model detection from messages
- Unified response handling
- Context-aware model interactions

## Working Applications
1. **Ramble (CLI)**
   - Basic chat functionality
   - Context management
   - Command system
   - Rich text formatting

2. **RambleMAXX (TUI)**
   - Terminal-based interface
   - Split-pane layout
   - Document/code viewing capability
   - Enhanced visual feedback

## TODOs and Future Enhancements

### LLMHarness Integration
- [ ] Implement proper async support
- [ ] Add retry/fallback logic
- [ ] Enhance error reporting
- [ ] Add streaming support
- [ ] Implement proper model switching

### Interface Improvements
- [ ] Complete terminal-style input in RambleMAXX
- [ ] Implement proper text wrapping
- [ ] Add document/code viewer switching
- [ ] Enhance visual feedback
- [ ] Add scroll view controls

### Tool System
- [ ] Complete MCP integration
- [ ] Implement tool discovery
- [ ] Add dynamic tool loading
- [ ] Create tool documentation system
- [ ] Add tool capability reporting

### Context Management
- [ ] Enhance context chaining
- [ ] Add better context visualization
- [ ] Implement context pruning
- [ ] Add context search/filter

### Living Room Preparation
- [ ] Document interface requirements
- [ ] Plan WebSocket integration
- [ ] Design community features
- [ ] Plan identity system integration

## Architecture Notes

### Interface Design Principles
1. Clean separation of concerns
2. Consistent API across implementations
3. Flexible capability system
4. Tool-based feature extension

### Controller Responsibilities
1. Message Controller
   - Message preprocessing
   - Context selection
   - Model routing
   - Response handling

2. Context Controller
   - Command processing
   - Context management
   - State maintenance
   - Debug facilities

3. Tool Controller
   - Tool registration
   - Capability exposure
   - Tool execution
   - MCP interaction

### Coordinator Pattern
The coordinator pattern we established provides:
- Central management of components
- Clean interaction patterns
- Future extensibility
- Clear responsibility boundaries

## Next Steps
1. Stabilize current implementations
2. Complete RambleMAXX UI
3. Enhance LLMHarness integration
4. Begin Living Room planning
5. Document all interfaces

## Notes for Future Development
- Keep the "outside art" aesthetic
- Focus on text and interaction
- Maintain clean architecture
- Plan for multi-model support
- Consider community aspects

This checkpoint represents a solid foundation for future development, with clear patterns established for building new interfaces while maintaining consistency and functionality.
