# Development Workflow
Date: November 5, 2024

## Overview
Coordinated development across chat and IDE interfaces.

### Interface Roles

1. Chat Interface (Planning)
- Architecture decisions
- Feature planning
- Documentation structure
- Interface design
- Code stubs

2. IDE Interface (Implementation)
- Code implementation
- Optimization
- Testing
- Documentation refinement

### Workflow Commands

```bash
/checkpoint    # Save architectural decisions
/reference     # Document implementation details
/arch         # Record architecture updates
/sync         # Synchronize understanding
/meta         # Discuss process improvements
```

## Documentation Flow
1. Initial planning in chat interface
2. Transfer to docs folder
3. Implementation details added in IDE
4. Documentation refinement
5. Regular sync between interfaces

### Communication Bridge
- Regular checkpoints
- Cross-reference between interfaces
- Document version control
- Clear ownership of changes
