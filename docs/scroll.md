# The Scroll Project: Checkpoint Summary

## Core Concept
- Continuous personal timeline ("scroll")
- YOUR data, YOUR control
- Tools/AI serve the scroll, not vice versa
- Privacy-first architecture

## Phase 1: Basic Scroll Implementation
1. Start with ramble/scramble base
2. Focus on continuous timeline
3. Simple MCP integration
4. Basic storage/retrieval
5. No local AI needed yet (Claude can handle tools)

## Future Directions
- WASM client implementation
- Local Tooldog AI
- Client/Server architecture
- BSD server component
- Hardware possibilities

## Key Principles
- Simplicity first
- Privacy focused
- Tool-based expansion
- User owns the scroll
- No big tech lock-in

## Next Steps
1. Get basic scrolling working
2. Implement basic MCP support
3. Test timeline concept
4. Evaluate WASM later
5. Keep BSD in mind for future
