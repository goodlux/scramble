# Compression Strategy
Date: November 5, 2024

## Overview
Multi-level compression strategy optimizing for both semantic retention and token efficiency.

### Compression Levels

1. Immediate Compression
- Used for active conversations
- Maintains high fidelity
- Optimizes for quick access
- Balances size vs. quality

2. Intermediate Compression
- Applied to recent contexts
- Higher compression ratio
- Good semantic retention
- Optimized for frequent access

3. Long-term Compression
- Maximum compression
- Core semantic preservation
- Optimized for storage
- Focuses on key information

### Implementation Approach

```python
class CompressionManager:
    def compress(self, text: str, level: CompressionLevel) -> Context:
        pass

    def decompress(self, context: Context) -> str:
        pass

    def recompress(self, context: Context, new_level: CompressionLevel) -> Context:
        pass
```

## Technical Details

### Compression Techniques
- Semantic chunking
- Token optimization
- Context deduplication
- Chain compression

### Quality Metrics
- Semantic similarity scores
- Token reduction ratios
- Retrieval accuracy
- Context coherence

### Progressive Compression
- Time-based progression
- Access-based optimization
- Quality thresholds
- Chain preservation
